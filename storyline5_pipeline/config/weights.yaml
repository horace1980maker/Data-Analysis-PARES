# Storyline 5 Portfolio Scoring Scenarios
# Each scenario defines weights for the four portfolio components
# All weights must sum to 1.0

# ============================================================================
# BALANCED SCENARIO (Default)
# ============================================================================
# Gives relatively equal consideration to all factors

balanced:
  w_impact_potential: 0.35         # From API (priority/risk/capacity)
  w_leverage: 0.25                 # From SCI/ELI (service/ecosystem leverage)
  w_equity_urgency: 0.20           # From EVI
  w_feasibility: 0.20              # From feasibility proxy

# ============================================================================
# EQUITY-FIRST SCENARIO
# ============================================================================
# Prioritizes bundles addressing the most vulnerable/excluded groups

equity_first:
  w_impact_potential: 0.30
  w_leverage: 0.20
  w_equity_urgency: 0.35           # Highest weight on equity
  w_feasibility: 0.15

# ============================================================================
# FEASIBILITY-FIRST SCENARIO
# ============================================================================
# Prioritizes bundles most likely to succeed (strong governance, low conflict)

feasibility_first:
  w_impact_potential: 0.30
  w_leverage: 0.20
  w_equity_urgency: 0.15
  w_feasibility: 0.35              # Highest weight on feasibility

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# Components:
#   - impact_potential: Combined priority (community importance) + risk (threat exposure) + capacity gap
#   - leverage: How critical the linked services/ecosystems are (SCI × ELI)
#   - equity_urgency: Differentiated impacts + access barriers + exclusion signals
#   - feasibility: Actor network strength + dialogue coverage - conflict risk
#
# Usage in scoring:
#   PortfolioScore = sum(weight_i × component_i_normalized)
#
# Tiers are assigned by quantile of PortfolioScore within each scope (overall/grupo).
